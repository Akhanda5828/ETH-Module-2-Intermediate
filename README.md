## Description
The SocialVerse smart contract is designed to create a decentralized social media platform where users can create posts, like posts, and manage funds. The contract includes functionalities for depositing and withdrawing funds, which are controlled by the contract owner. The platform can be paused and unpaused by the owner to manage contract activities securely.

## Getting Started
# Installing

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:
``
   npm i
``

## Sample Smart Contract Code



## Executing program

1. Open three terminals in your VS Code and navigate to the project directory in each terminal.
2. In the first terminal, start the local blockchain node:
   ``
    npx hardhat node
   ``
4. In the second terminal, deploy the contract to the local blockchain network:
   ``
    npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
   ``
5. In the third terminal, launch the front-end of the project:
   ``
    npm run dev
   ``
The project should now be running on your localhost, typically at http://localhost:3000/.


## Working

We will document the deployed contract address and subsequently develop the projectâ€™s frontend. This frontend will establish a connection with the MetaMask wallet, directing the user to the wallet page for transaction approvals. Users will be able to create and 'like' posts, which will redirect them to MetaMask to authorize transactions. However, the 'Deposit' and 'Withdraw' functions will be disabled due to security concerns, as this network is not secure for fund transfers. This is a custom condition implemented for this project.
